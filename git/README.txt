I tried to write my own neural network that copies filters
on the available images (before and after processing)
and changes the images accordingly.

I was young and stupid, sooooo :)
Project is not refactored.

"1.after", "1.before" and "2.after", "2.before" are pictures to train the system.
"cute" and "have" are pictures to process.

"cute_done" and "DOOO...(n * 0)....ONE" (I was so happy, sorry)
is processed pictures.

main code in "new_nero_with_library.py"
"Nero_3_layers_library.py" is library to nero.

txt files are keeping info about nero working attempts.
"copy_filtres.py" use it info to process the image.

I should put this chaos in order in the future))).
